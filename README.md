# iframely_sample
This is a sample about how to use iFramely on NextJs.

----

[Original Sample](https://iframely.com/docs/react)

Based on my attempt to use Iframely on the following versions of NextJs and React, I had to do some changes to the sample they offer to get embeded links to work.

    - "next": "15.2.2"
    - "react": "18.2.0"

You can my example under 'iframely_sample/nextjs_sample.tsx'.

Hope it helps you and happy coding!
